This is a busy Wendy's and I pop in every month or so for lunch.
This Wendy's is great. 
I went to this Wendy's for the first time today and I was actually quite pleased with my experience. 
Despite the lunch hour rush, I got my food quickly and the employees were very nice. 
I actually haven't had Wendy's for years, but their burgers were pleasant surprise!
This place is a really good place for lunch.
If you are going to get fast food, this is the best place.
For a Wendy's, I like the staff here! 
Wendy's is known for its better fast foods. 
Inexpensive and tasty Wendy's chilli is great.
